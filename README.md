Mars Rover Problem

From the MarsRover repository, click on the green Code button and click “download zip.” This will download all the necessary files. 

Unzip the zip file and navigate to MarsRover folder and open the MarsRover.sln file and open the file in Visual Studio. 

In Visual Studio, if it warns about opening a project from the internet, click okay to load the solution. 

Next, find the Solution Explorer panel. If this panel is missing, in Windows, click View at the top of the window and then click Solution Explorer. 

In the Solution Explorer click the triangle next to MarsRover and double click Program.cs and Rover.cs. Next, click the triangle next to MarsRoverTests and double click RoverShould.cs. This will open all three class files as tabs so the code can be reviewed. 

To run, make sure MarsRover is selected and click the green play button at the top of the screen.  


To run the MarsRoverTests, open the Test Explorer panel. If it's not visible, at the top of the screen click View and select Test Explorer. On the Test Explorer panel, click on the double green triangle button to run all tests. There are 5 tests in the RoverShould.cs class.
